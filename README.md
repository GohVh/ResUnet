# ResUnet
This model is based on the paper [End-to-end Res-Unet based reconstruction algorithm for photoacoustic imaging] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7510873/).

In the paper, input was in the form of photoacoustic signal with dimension of (512, 128) to generate an output image of (128, 128)
Input and output dimension was modified to be (224, 224).Cancel changes
